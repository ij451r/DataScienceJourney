    "### What is Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is all about bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, i.e., a class. It is used to hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world and only expose a limited, well-defined interface to interact with the object. This protects the integrity of the data and prevents external interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, encapsulation can be seen as the process of enclosing the data and the operations that manipulate that data within a protective container (the class). It helps in organizing the code, improving code readability, and making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase."

   "source": [
    "### Why do we need encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Protection: By making data members private, we prevent direct access to them from outside the class. This reduces the risk of accidental data modification and ensures that the data is accessed and modified only through controlled methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Maintainability: Encapsulation promotes modularity, meaning each class is responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This makes the code easier to maintain and understand, as changes in one class do not affect other parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Encapsulation allows us to create reusable class components with well-defined interfaces. This means we can use the same class in different parts of our code without worrying about its internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: By controlling access to the data through methods, we can enforce constraints and validation rules, ensuring that the data remains consistent and valid."

   "source": [
    "### Use of private data members in encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can use access modifiers to control the visibility of attributes and methods in a class. Private attributes are denoted by double underscores __ before their names, like __private_attr. They are only accessible within the class itself and cannot be accessed directly from outside the class."
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "9e1d7931",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Mangling technique\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, name mangling is a technique used for private attributes to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses. When a name is prefixed with double underscores inside a class, Python performs name mangling by adding _ClassName before the name, where ClassName is the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a private attribute __private_attr inside a class MyClass, it gets internally stored as _MyClass__private_attr. This makes it harder for external code to accidentally access private attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that name mangling is more of a convention rather than a strict access control mechanism. It is not intended to enforce security but to signal that the attribute is intended for internal use within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example shown earlier, we used name mangling to access the private attribute __registration_id directly. However, it's generally recommended to use setter and getter methods for interacting with private attributes, as it provides a controlled interface and follows the principles of encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, encapsulation is a powerful concept that ensures proper data hiding and code organization in object-oriented programming, leading to more robust and maintainable software."

This means that objects of the subclass can be used interchangeably with objects of the base class, thanks to the common method names."

    "Encapsulation: This involves the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class). The data is hidden from outside access, and only the class's methods can interact with it, ensuring data integrity and providing control over data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: This allows a class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). It promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: This refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In particular, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, providing a unified interface to different implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction differs from the other principles in that it emphasizes the creation of abstract classes and methods that define a blueprint for other classes to follow, without providing full implementation details. The other principles focus on how classes interact (encapsulation), how they inherit and share properties (inheritance), and how different objects can be treated uniformly (polymorphism)."
